I'm a Front-End and Web Developer who graduated from Nucamp Coding Bootcamp with certifications in Front-End Web and Mobile Development, Back-End Development, and even Full Stack Development as well. In my spare time I try to pour in as much time I can coding any project or solving any coding challenges on CodeWars or Hackerrank. I'm currently job hunting at the present moment so I am open to remote roles as I like to be able to spend time with my daughter and have a work-life balance that works best for me. Please feel free to contact me with the form down below with serious inquiries.</p>
